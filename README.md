If you wish to compile from the source, the source files can be found in the src/deadwood folder. The main class is Deadwood.java.
This program was built using NetBeans IDE v 8.2, so if you're having trouble building the file, you might try running it using NetBeans.

This program was written, built, and tested on Windows machines, so there might be minor cosmetic issues on Mac and Linux, but the game logic should be sound.
