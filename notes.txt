Things that need to be done:
	Changes in the model are reflected in the view
		
	User actions in the view are reflected in the model
	
	Keeping track of which use cases are allowed at which times
	
	
GUI methods that should have Controller methods called after them:
	-initializeNewDay() in BoardPane.java
	
I used controller in movePlayerLabelTo() in BoardPane to test it
